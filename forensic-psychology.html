            <p style="text-indent: 3rem;">
                Forensic Psychologists play an active role in the legal system, providing attorneys and judges with
                valuable information about the defendants who stand before them. Often times these individuals presenta
                complex picture with respect to the psychological factors that contributed to their legal predicament.
                Despite attempts to ‘profile’ individuals who commit crimes, there is no single “type” of law violator.
                Sometimes the people we least expect to violate the law, do so with unusual expertise and cunning. For
                others, their behavior might seem more predictable if we examine the psychosocial factors that are
                often related to crime. Still other defendants might be struggling with hidden
                emotional/psychological problems that are imperceptible until he or she finally commits an unimaginable
                crime. But, defendants differ
                considerably in terms of their backgrounds, motivations, temperaments, the degree to which they are
                ‘entrenched’ in criminal behavior, whether or not they can be rehabilitated, not to mention the ease
                with
                which they understand their legal situation or are receptive to the efforts of defense counsel.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 3rem;">
                Forensic psychologists address many issues that arise with defendants, some of which can have a
                significant impact on the outcome of their case. These issues include their mental state, competency,
                chronic
                mental illness, substance abuse, history of trauma, resistances to counsel, anxiety about their legal
                situation, cognitive, emotional and historical factors that impact their decision making and judgment.
                Forensic psychologists apply psychological theories, principles, research and practices to these
                challenging
                legal situations, offering insights into the minds of those who knowingly, inadvertently or chronically
                break
                the law whether embezzling millions of dollars from the local credit union where they work, stealing
                someone’s identity, robbing the corner grocery store or taking someone’s life.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 3rem;">
                Forensic Psychologists also evaluate the emotional/psychological impact of physical injuries resulting
                from work and motor vehicle accidents, sexual assault and discrimination. Forensic psychologists
                recognize
                the sometimes fragile nature of the human psyche and how the lingering effects of a physical or
                psychological injury can result in significant loss in productivity, income and life satisfaction as
                the client
                struggles with depression, anxiety and posttraumatic stress.

                Dr. Davis has
                provided forensic services in pre-trial and post-conviction (Habeas) capital cases, has evaluated
                defendants for mental competency and criminal responsibility. Dr. Davis provides psychological
                evaluations for sentencing purposes in both state and federal courts. She has provided expert testimony
                regarding the psychosocial factors associated with criminal conduct, sentencing alternatives,
                disposition, and as an education about psychological concepts that might be more difficult for the
                triers-of-fact to understand. One such area is psychological testing as well as the distinction between
                ‘risk’ factors and ‘causal’ factors associated with crime.
